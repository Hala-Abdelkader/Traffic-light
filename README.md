## Overview

Welcome to our Traffic light system.
              It was required to make two moods: Normal and pedestrian modes. In this project, I used ATMEGA 32. Also, I programmed my microcontroller with Microchip Studio and used Proteus for simulation. The normal mode is to make each LED on for 5 sec. while the others are turned off and their sequence (RED-YELLOW-GREEN-YELLOW). The pedestrian mode is used to interrupt the normal mode to help the pedestrians to cross the road, this mood is activated by push button which when pressed while the car's green or yellow LEDs are ON, the yellow LED will be on for 5 sec then the cars’ red LED will be on for 5 sec. If we press the button while the car’s red LED is on, nothing happens.
